    Neila’s life is turned upside down when she meets a man, who claims to be no other than the Norse God, Loki.
    This then sets off a series of events, during which she is plunged into the mythologies, getting to know the reality that lies behind.

    Throughout Loki’s doings and deeds, Neila also gets accidentally swooped up by the happenings around him, spiriting her away to other worlds.
    Travelling around the nine realms, she learns about their true relations with each other while finding some new friends along the way.

    However, nothing is for free, and Neila soon finds out the price to pay for the knowledge she seeks.
